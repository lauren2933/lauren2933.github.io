        <!--Write some words about yourself in the p tags-->
        <p> I am currently a literature and language so I can pursue pre-education. Initially, I wanted to become a veterinarian, however, I realized I did not like science or math particularly much. I decided to change my major to education because I really love learning about English, and I think I would do a good job teaching others about the subject. I also plan to minor in psychology so I can work at being a guidance counselor as well. I have received some bad advice before, so I would like to help others in the ways which I was not. My hobbies are cooking and my dogs. I started learning how to cook over the summer and I find it to be rewarding cooking for other people. I enjoy cooking desserts for our occasional family cookouts. I like cooking and baking, and I find it fun and interesting to try different things. The best thing my family thinks I make are apple dumplings. I now have three dogs because my dog just had a puppy. The dadâ€™s name is Pete, the mom Tink, and the puppy Buster. The Issue I feel strongly about is raising awareness about Dementia. The reason for this is because this summer my great grandmother passed away, and she also had dementia. It was hard dealing with this because I was not aware of this until her symptoms were bad and very obvious. I would like to educate people on the illness and show how it effects families and the person who has the disease.</p>

        <h2>Dementia Awareness</h2>
        <a href="http://www.alz.org/dementia/types-of-dementia.asp">
        <p> I plan to try and raise awareness of dementia.</a> I have chosen this topic because this summer my great gradmother died, and she died not knowing anyone because of dementia. I did not know she had dementia until her symptoms became very bad. I think it is important that people know what the disease is and how it differs from other similar illness. I want people to know the early signs and symptoms of dementia so they can become more aware of what is going on in the earliest stages. My aduience will mainly be people who are suffering with the disease, and their familes, but the audience is also the general public becasue it can happen to anyone.   </p>
