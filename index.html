											<h3> This is the first post in a series of posts related to different demtnia related topics. </h3>
											<p> The day she stopped saying my name is the day I knew she forgot me. As a college student, I have only ever heard dementia mentioned a few times, however, I have never known what dementia truly means. I did not know any signs or symptoms of the brain killing disease; however, I would have benefited greatly if I had any dementia-related knowledge. Dementia introduced itself to me when...</p>

												<h2>The Facts: An Interview with Dr. Martha Anderson</h2>

											<iframe width="784" height="303" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3OTUI_kAhY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
											<h3>When getting information on any topic it is always useful to get an opinion from a professional, like Dr. Martha Anderson.</h3>
											<p>I think it is important to get as much helpful information as possible when learning about something new, or in this case, dementia. For my video, I was able to interview Dr. Martha Anderson, to discuss some of the most important aspects of dementia and dementia care. Dr. Martha Anderson is also involved in important research regarding both dementia patients and caregivers. I have a link to her research video in the description on my YouTube channel if you want to learn more about her research. By interviewing Dr. Martha Anderson, I gained a great deal of knowledge about dementia. I learned many new facts you can’t find on the internet. If you are learning about dementia as well, the internet is a very helpful tool, but it is also vital you talk to medical professionals so you can learn about all aspects of dementia. Doctors and other healthcare professionals can discuss private matters with you and clarify any misconceptions you may still have.  </p>

												<h2>Dedication</h2>
											</header>
											<img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt=""/>
											<h3>Pictured Left is myself, Pictured center is my great-grandma, and Pictured right is my sister</h3>
											<p>I have devoted my website to learning about dementia, but the real inspiration behind all of my work is my great-grandmother, or as I call her, Mammy. She was a hard-working, passionate and caring woman. She worked for everything she had, and wouldn’t hesitate to help anyone in need. Mammy worked in the fields pulling up weeds while she was in her 60’s and 70’s, which is why it was so hard to fathom she had dementia. The hardest working woman I have ever met, ended up needing our help. I have dedicated my website to her because she dedicated her life to me and so many others, and I know there are others like her, which is why more people should have knowledge and awareness of dementia. We need to understand how difficult it is to live with, and how difficult it is to care for someone with dementia so we can grow as a community and selflessly help each other.  </p>

																<h3>Alzheimer's and Dementia: What You Need to Know</h3>
															</header>
															<img align ="left" src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" />
															<p>A very good resource I have been using to help my journey with learning about dementia is the Alzheimer's Association. I was able to interview Dr. Karen Roberto, a professor at Virginia Tech, who is also a part of the Alzheimer's Association. Dr. Roberto was able to tell me more about what the Alzheimer's association does to help raise awareness for dementia, as well as answer some very important questions about dementia.</p>
