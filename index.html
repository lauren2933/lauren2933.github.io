											<h3><Strong>Mind</Strong></h3>
										</header>
										<p> When first exploring Dementia, you will find it has a great deal to do with the mind. Your loved one will become forgetful. It may not be severe at first, but almost all Dementias are progressive, meaning they become worse. Your loved can also become frustrated and angry. Continue exploring my website to find ways to combat any frustrations you or your loved one may have.  </p>

										<p>I want to give you access to the best resources possible, so you can have all of your questions answered. I also want to spread awareness of Dementia. While many organizations raise awareness for Dementia, they often put the most effort into raising awareness on World Alzheimer’s Day (September 21st). Click below to find out more about World Alzheimer’s Day and what you can do to raise awareness or get more information regarding Dementia. </p>

										<p>If or when Dementia becomes an active part of your life, make sure to remember family. Family is crucial when dealing with Dementia because family members support each other and make any transition easier. In in many of my medium posts, which you can read below, you will see how much family is involved in caring for family members with Dementia. </p>

											<h3> This is the first post in a series of posts related to different demtnia related topics. </h3>

As a college student, I have only ever heard dementia mentioned a few times, however, I have never known what dementia truly means. I did not know any signs or symptoms of the brain killing disease; however, I would have benefited greatly if I had any dementia-related knowledge. Dementia introduced itself to me when...</p>

												<h2>The Facts: An Interview with Dr. Martha Anderson</h2>

											<iframe width="784" height="303" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3OTUI_kAhY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
											<h3>When getting information on any topic it is always useful to get an opinion from a professional, like Dr. Martha Anderson.</h3>
											<p>I think it is important to get as much helpful information as possible when learning about something new, or in this case, Dementia. For my video, I was able to interview Dr. Martha Anderson, to discuss some of the most important aspects of Dementia and Dementia care. Dr. Martha Anderson is also involved in important research regarding both Dementia patients and caregivers. I have a link to her research video in the description on my YouTube channel if you want to learn more about her research. By interviewing Dr. Martha Anderson, I gained a great deal of knowledge about Dementia. I learned many new facts you can’t find on the internet. If you are learning about Dementia as well, the internet is a very helpful tool, but it is also vital you talk to medical professionals so you can learn about all aspects of Dementia. Doctors and other healthcare professionals can discuss private matters with you and clarify any misconceptions you may still have.  </p>

											<h3>Pictured Left is myself, Pictured center is my great-grandma, and Pictured right is my sister</h3>
											<p>I have devoted my website to learning about Dementia, but the real inspiration behind all of my work is my great-grandmother, or as I call her, Mammy. She was a hard-working, passionate, and caring woman. She worked for everything she had, and wouldn’t hesitate to help anyone in need. Mammy worked in the fields pulling up weeds while she was in her 60’s and 70’s, which is why it was so hard to fathom she had Dementia. The hardest working woman I have ever met, ended up needing our help. I have dedicated my website to her because she dedicated her life to me and so many others, and I know there are others like her, which is why more people should have knowledge and awareness of Dementia. We need to understand how difficult it is to live with, and how difficult it is to care for someone with Dementia so we can grow as a community and selflessly help each other.  </p>

																<h3>Alzheimer's and Dementia: What You Need to Know</h3>
															</header>
															<img align ="left" src="images/pic06.jpg" alt="" style="padding-right:15px;" />
															<p>A very good resource I have been using to help my journey with learning about dementia is the Alzheimer's Association. I was able to interview Dr. Karen Roberto, a professor at Virginia Tech, who is also a part of the Alzheimer's Association. Dr. Roberto was able to tell me more about what the Alzheimer's association does to help raise awareness for dementia, as well as answer some very important questions about dementia.</p>
