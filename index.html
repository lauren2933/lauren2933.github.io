											<h3> This is the first post in a series of posts related to different demtnia related topics. </h3>
											<p> The day she stopped saying my name is the day I knew she forgot me. As a college student, I have only had a general idea on the subject of dementia. I did not know any signs or symptoms of the brain killing disease. The knowledge of symptoms would have been helpful to me a few years ago...	 </p>

												<h2>The Facts: An Interview with Dr. Martha Anderson</h2>
											</header>
											<iframe width="784" height="303" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I3OTUI_kAhY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
											<p>I think it is important to get as much helpful information as possible when learning about something new, or in this case, dementia. Not only am I using helpful websites to get my infomation, but I am also getting answers from medical professionals. For my video, I was able to interview Dr. Martha Anderson, to discuss some of the most important aspects of dementia and dementia care. Dr. Martha Anderson is also involved in important research regarding both dementia patients and caregivers. I have a link to her research video under the description of my video on my YouTube channel if you want to learn more about her research.</p>

															<p>I am not a doctor, so I am not attempting to give a diagnosis. What I am trying to do is give a list of symptoms, so if you are worried your loved one had dementia, you can talk to a doctor to get a real diagnosis and look up more information about the diagnosis.

															<p>Everyone’s story has a beginning and an end. How well your ending goes depends on the steps you take throughout your story. You and your loved one should prepare for the end immediately once the doctor diagnoses them with dementia. Most people would rather not think about their story’s end, but you and your loved one can have a much smoother transition when their dementia progresses if you are prepared. Your loved one needs to decide what they want later in life...</p>

															<p>A very good resource I have been using to help my journey with learning about dementia is the Alzheimer's Association. I was able to interview Dr. Karen Roberto, a professor at Virginia Tech, who is also a part of the Alzheimer's Association. Dr. Roberto was able to tell me more about what the Alzheimer's association does to help raise awareness for dementia, as well as answer some very important questions about dementia.</p>

																<h3>Dedication</h3>
															</header>
															<a href="#" class="image left"><img src="images/pic07.jpg" alt="" /></a>
															<p>I have devoted this website to learning about dementia, but the real inspiration behind my passion is my great-grandmother. She was a hard-working, passionate, and caring woman. She worked for everything she had, and wouldn't hesitate to help anyone in need. She ended up having dementia, which is why I have dedicated this webstite to her. I want to make sure people know the truth about dementia, especially if they end up becoming diagnosed like my great-grandmother. Dementia is by no means an easy topic to discuss, but everyone needs to know the truth.</p>
